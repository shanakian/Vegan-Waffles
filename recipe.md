If starting with cornmeal instead of pinole, toast lightly in a pan over medium heat for about 5 minutes, until it's lightly browned and fragrant. If your using real pinole, grind in coffee grinder to make a fine flour.

Preheat waffle iron

Stir together the cornmeal, chia, ground oats, salt, and baking powder. In a seperate bowl, mix together the applesauce, hmp milk, coconut oil, maple syrup, and vanilla( coconut oil needs to be warm so you may need to microwave it into its loiquid state )

Stir wet ingredients into the dry to combine into a smooth batter. Spray waffle iron with baking spray even if it's nonstick, and pour batter into hot iron. Follow direction of you waffle iron or  wait until iron stops steaming.

Carefully remove waffles from iron, respray with cooking spray, and repeat. This was enough to make 5 small waffles.
